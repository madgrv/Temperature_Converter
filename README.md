# Temperature_Converter
A JavaScript temperature converter with user interface.

## Brief:
Write the code that will do the following:
1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do. The first output that the 
      user sees when the program runs should say:
             In which metric is the temperature you are converting?
             C - Celsius
             F - Fahrenheit
             K - Kelvin
 2. The user should then be asked to userValue the number they want to convert.
 3. Next, the user should choose what they want to convert their current temperature to. For example:
             To which metric would you like to convert the temperature?
             C - Celsius
             F - Fahrenheit
             K - Kelvin
 4. The program should print out the answer in the following format:
    -273°C is 0K. (there's a typo in the text here it should be 0.15K)
 5. The program should be able to convert from any of the three metrics to any of the three metrics.
    Conversion formulae:
    
      ● Celsius from:
          ○ Fahrenheit: C = (F -32) x 5/9
          ○ Kelvin: C = K - 273.15

      ● Fahrenheit from:
          ○ Celsius:F=Cx9/5+32
          ○ Kelvin:F=kx9/5-459.67

      ● Kelvin from:
          ○ Celsius: K = C + 273.15
          ○ Fahrenheit: K = (F + 459.67) x 5/9



Error handling was not requested (nor taught yet) at the time of the assignment but I have added it doing my own research to make a complete program//
